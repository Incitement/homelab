# homelab

This is a basic repo to keep track of my homelab as it grows. I am using this mostly as a sandbox for playing around with log analysis and managing VMs, and I am looking to stand up a proper environment for analyzing malware (and therefore more logs!). Also general functions such as file storage/streaming, development environment(s), etc.
